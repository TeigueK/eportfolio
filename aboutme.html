                Why nuclear engineering?
            </p>
            <p style="padding-left: 15px;">
                I chose to major in nuclear engineering because it's
                the world's most effective tool in slowing climate change. My choice
                is a commitment to the safety and livelihoods of every person on this
                planet, including my own. To me, a chance to intern or 
                work at a nuclear power plant is a chance to contribute to a
                proud and important pillar of our world.
                <br>
                <br>
                I'm interested in performing and publishing my own research,
                but I'd also like to work at a non-research, energy-producing plant.
                Due to this impasse of mine, I'd love an opportunity at an internship
                to better gauge which niche of the nuclear energy industry is the best
                fit for me.

                I love leading and working with a team:
            </p>
            <p style="padding-left: 15px;">
                To me, being part of a team means recognizing both your
                responsibility and limitations as an individual.
                <br>
                <br>
                I've played Quizbowl, a 5-versus-5 trivia extracurricular, 
                since I was a freshman in high school. Because of my commitment
                and passion for the sport, I was team captain for three of my four
                years there. But, beyond this, instructing  and assisting new members
                and my longtime peers made me happy. During my time as captain,
                the club's membership grew from less than 5 to over 30. Even though I've graduated,
                I continue to reach out to new members.
                <br>
                <br>
                While being an instructor made me happy, I knew that I
                <span style="font-style: italic"> needed </span> skilled members
                to help me beat other schools. I knew I couldn't do it without them.
                As I continue to compete in college with a new team, this
                necessity of cooperation and coordination is increasingly felt.

                Penn State has taught me the value of community and partnership:
            </p>
            <p style="padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 15px;">
                Before coming to college, I was mainly focused on my career
                and academic success. While I'm still very dedicated to both of these,
                the beauty of other people's minds weighs heavily in my heart. Learning about
                a person's hobbies, history, passions, and ideas continually convinces
                me that our greatest strength as humans is our ability to share our unique
                viewpoints.

                In much the same way that genetic variety increases the fitness of a species,
                the synthesis of many different hard-working experts' contributions, both in STEM 
                and outside of it, assures a greater quality in our mental output
                as researchers and engineers.
