                Why nuclear engineering?
            </p>
            <p style="padding-left: 15px;">
                I chose to major in nuclear engineering because it's
                the world's most effective tool in <span style="color: rgb(248, 103, 123);">
                    slowing climate change</span>. My choice
                is a <span style="color: rgb(248, 103, 123);">commitment to safety</span> and the livelihoods of every person on this
                planet, including my own. To me, a chance to intern or 
                work at a nuclear power plant is a chance to <span style="color: rgb(248, 103, 123);">
                    contribute</span> to a
                proud and important pillar of our world.
                <br>
                <br>
                I'm interested in performing and publishing my own <span style="color: rgb(248, 103, 123);">
                    research</span>,
                but I'd also like to work at a non-research, energy-producing plant.
                Due to this impasse of mine, I'd love an opportunity at an <span style="color: rgb(248, 103, 123);">
                    internship</span>
                to better gauge which niche of the nuclear energy industry is the best
                fit for me.

                I love leading and working with a team:
            </p>
            <p style="padding-left: 15px;">
                To me, being part of a team means recognizing both your
                <span style="color: rgb(248, 103, 123);">responsibility and limitations as an individual</span>.
                <br>
                <br>
                I've played <span style="color: rgb(248, 103, 123);">Quizbowl</span>, a 5-versus-5 trivia extracurricular, 
                since I was a freshman in high school. Because of my <span style="color: rgb(248, 103, 123);">
                    commitment
                and passion</span> for the sport, I was <span style="color: rgb(248, 103, 123);">
                    team captain</span> for three of my four
                years there. But, beyond this, <span style="color: rgb(248, 103, 123);">
                    instructing  and assisting</span> new members
                and my longtime peers made me happy. During my time as captain,
                the club's membership grew from less than 5 to over 30. Even though I've graduated,
                I continue to reach out to new members.
                <br>
                <br>
                While being an instructor made me happy, I knew that I
                <span style="font-style: italic"> needed </span> skilled members
                to help me beat other schools. I knew I couldn't do it without them.
                As I continue to compete in college with a new team, this
                <span style="color: rgb(248, 103, 123);">necessity of cooperation and coordination</span> is increasingly felt.

                Penn State has taught me the value of community and partnership:

            <p style="padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 15px;">
                Before coming to college, I was mainly focused on my career
                and academic success. While I'm still very dedicated to both of these,
                the <span style="color: rgb(248, 103, 123);">beauty of other people's minds</span> weighs 
                    heavily in my heart. Learning about
                a person's hobbies, history, passions, and ideas continually convinces
                me that <span style="color: rgb(248, 103, 123);">our greatest strength as humans is our ability to share our unique
                viewpoints.</span>
                <br>
                <br>
                In much the same way that genetic variety increases the fitness of a species,
                the <span style="color: rgb(248, 103, 123);">
                    synthesis of many different hard-working experts' contributions</span>
                , both in STEM 
                and outside of it, assures a greater quality in our mental output
                as researchers and engineers.
